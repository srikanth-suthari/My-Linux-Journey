# üêß Linux Journey Day 1: Setup & Basic Navigation

Welcome to my 15-day Linux journey! Today was all about getting the environment set up and taking the first steps into the command line. It's the start of something new and exciting.

---

### ## Today's Goal
My objective was to **install a Linux distribution** in a virtual machine and learn the absolute basics of **moving around the file system** from the terminal.

---

### ## What I Learned
- **Kernel vs. Distro:** I learned that Linux itself is the **kernel**, while a **distribution** (like Ubuntu) bundles the kernel with software and a desktop environment to make it a complete OS.
- **Virtual Machine:** Setting up **Ubuntu** in **VirtualBox** was straightforward. It's a great way to run Linux without affecting my main operating system.
- **The Shell:** The terminal is my new workspace. I learned that the **shell (Bash)** is the program that takes my commands and tells the OS what to do.
- **My Location:** I now understand the concept of the **home directory (`~`)** as my personal space and the **root directory (`/`)** as the top-level folder for the entire system.



---

### ## Commands I Practiced
- **`pwd`**: (**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory) ‚Äî My "you are here" map marker.
- **`ls`**: (**L**i**s**t) ‚Äî Shows me the contents of the directory I'm in. I also practiced with options like `ls -l` for more detail.
- **`cd`**: (**C**hange **D**irectory) ‚Äî The command I used to navigate between folders like `/etc` and back home (`cd ~`).
- **`man`**: (**Man**ual) ‚Äî My new best friend for getting help. `man ls` gave me a complete guide to all the things `ls` can do.

### ## My Experience
*(This is your space to write! For example: The Ubuntu installation was smoother than I expected. At first, the terminal felt a bit empty, but after navigating around, I started to see how powerful it is. I got lost once but used `cd ~` to get back home. The `man` page for `ls` was a bit overwhelming, but I found the `-a` option to show hidden files really interesting.)*

**Onward to Day 2:** Creating and managing files. I'm ready to start building!
