# üêß Linux Journey Day 2: File Management & Viewing

Day two is in the books! After learning how to navigate yesterday, today was all about actually **interacting with the file system**. Instead of using a mouse to right-click and create folders, I'm doing everything from the command line. It feels incredibly efficient.

---

### ## Today's Goal
My objective was to **create, manage, and view the contents of files and directories** directly from the terminal, solidifying my understanding of the basic commands that are used every day.

---

### ## What I Learned
- **Creating:** I can instantly create directories with `mkdir` and empty files with `touch`. It's much faster than using a GUI.
- **Copy vs. Move:** I now understand the difference between `cp` (which duplicates a file) and `mv` (which either renames a file or moves it to a new directory).
- **The Danger of `rm`:** The `rm` command is permanent! There's no recycle bin, which forces me to be more careful and deliberate with my commands.
- **Viewing vs. Editing:** I learned how to view files quickly with `cat` or more interactively with `less` (which is great for long files). For actual editing, the terminal-based editor `nano` is simple and intuitive to start with.

### ## Commands I Practiced
- **`mkdir`**: **M**a**k**e **dir**ectory.
- **`touch`**: Create a new, empty file.
- **`cp`**: **C**o**p**y a file or directory.
- **`mv`**: **M**o**v**e or rename a file or directory.
- **`rm`**: **R**e**m**ove a file (use `rm -r` for directories).
- **`cat`**: Quickly display the entire content of a file.
- **`less`**: View the content of a long file page by page.
- **`nano`**: A user-friendly, terminal-based text editor.

### ## My Experience
*(This is your space to write! For example: I successfully created a project directory, made a few text files, and practiced moving them around. Using `nano` felt a bit strange without a mouse, but the on-screen keyboard shortcuts were very helpful. I almost deleted the wrong file with `rm`, which was a good lesson in double-checking my commands!) *

**Onward to Day 3:** I'm ready to tackle file permissions and the `sudo` command.
